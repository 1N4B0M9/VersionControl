## Github! :tada:

If you didn't make a GitHub account already, do that super quick right now _because_:

This week we will be applying some of our command-line knowledge to learn how to use `git`! The format for today is the same as last week: follow along with me in your lecture notebook. Then, at the end, I'll explain your group project assignment!


## Getting Startedâ„¢

1. In JupyterLab, open a `Terminal` and `cd` into your class folder.
2. Copy and paste this command
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/week-6.git
    ```
    - If you can't seem to paste anything, try using Ctrl+Shift+V (or Command+Shift+V)
3. You should see a new folder named `week-6` inside your class folder
4. Open up the lab lecture and follow along!

### If JupyterLab _really_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.
